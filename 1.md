# Gradle Publish Workflow

This document provides information on how to use the Gradle Publish GitHub Action. This action automatically calculates the next version, builds, and publishes your project, and creates a GitHub release.

## Workflow Description

The action is triggered whenever there's a push to the `main` branch. It sets up the necessary Java environment, caches Gradle dependencies, calculates the next version based on your commit message, builds and publishes your project using Gradle, and finally, if the release is not a snapshot, creates a GitHub release.

## Versioning

The versioning is done according to the semantic versioning rules (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). The type of version increment (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH) is decided based on the keyword found in the PR name. The keywords and corresponding version increments are as follows:

- `chore`: Increment the MAJOR version.
- `feat`: Increment the MINOR version.
- `fix`: Increment the PATCH version.

In case no matching keyword is found, a snapshot version is created with the same version as the last one. If no previous version can be found, the version defaults to "1.0.0".

## How to Create PR Names

To create a PR name, you should include one of the keywords (`chore`, `feat`, `fix`) in square brackets at the beginning of the PR name. For example:

- `[chore] Remove deprecated methods`
- `[feat] Add new API endpoint`
- `[fix] Resolve null pointer exception issue`

## How to Create Commit Messages

Commit messages do not directly affect the versioning. However, it's a good practice to keep your commit messages clear and descriptive. A typical commit message that aligns with this workflow might look like this:

- `chore: Remove deprecated methods`
- `feat: Add new API endpoint`
- `fix: Resolve null pointer exception issue`

## Secrets

You need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

- `ARTIFACTORY_USER`: Your Artifactory username.
- `ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY`: Your Artifactory API key.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: A GitHub token with the `repo` scope for creating releases.

By following these guidelines, you can leverage the Gradle Publish action to automate the build, versioning, and release of your Java projects.
