# Gradle Publish Workflow

This document provides information on how to use the Gradle Publish GitHub Action. This action automatically calculates the next version, builds, and publishes your project, and creates a GitHub release.

## Workflow Description

The action is triggered whenever there's a push to the `main` branch. It sets up the necessary Java environment, caches Gradle dependencies, calculates the next version based on your commit message, builds and publishes your project using Gradle, and finally, if the release is not a snapshot, creates a GitHub release.

## Versioning

The versioning is done according to the semantic versioning rules (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). The type of version increment (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH) is decided based on the keyword found in the PR name. The keywords and corresponding version increments are as follows:

- `chore`: Increment the MAJOR version.
- `feat`: Increment the MINOR version.
- `fix`: Increment the PATCH version.

In case no matching keyword is found, a snapshot version is created with the same version as the last one. If no previous version can be found, the version defaults to "1.0.0".

## How to Create PR Names

To create a PR name, you should include one of the keywords (`chore`, `feat`, `fix`) in square brackets at the beginning of the PR name. For example:

- `[chore] Remove deprecated methods`
- `[feat] Add new API endpoint`
- `[fix] Resolve null pointer exception issue`

## How to Create Commit Messages

Commit messages do not directly affect the versioning. However, it's a good practice to keep your commit messages clear and descriptive. A typical commit message that aligns with this workflow might look like this:

- `chore: Remove deprecated methods`
- `feat: Add new API endpoint`
- `fix: Resolve null pointer exception issue`

## Secrets

You need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

- `ARTIFACTORY_USER`: Your Artifactory username.
- `ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY`: Your Artifactory API key.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: A GitHub token with the `repo` scope for creating releases.

By following these guidelines, you can leverage the Gradle Publish action to automate the build, versioning, and release of your Java projects.



# Gradle Build and Publish Workflow

This document provides information on how to use the Gradle Build and Publish GitHub Action. This action allows you to manually trigger a build and/or a release of your project with a specified version.

## Workflow Description

The action can be manually triggered from the GitHub UI, allowing you to choose whether to build the project, release the Gradle snapshot to Artifactory, or both. The build and release processes are performed in a Java environment and Gradle dependencies are cached to speed up subsequent runs.

You can specify the version to be published when triggering the workflow.

## Triggering the Workflow

To trigger the workflow, navigate to the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository, select the "Gradle Build and Publish" workflow, and click "Run workflow". You'll be prompted to input your desired actions and the version to be published.

The input fields are as follows:

- `build`: Whether to build the project. Default is `true`.
- `release`: Whether to release the Gradle snapshot to Artifactory. Default is `false`.
- `version`: The version to be published. This is required.

## PR Names and Commit Messages

PR names and commit messages do not directly affect this workflow as the version is manually specified when triggering the workflow. However, it's a good practice to keep your PR names and commit messages clear and descriptive to maintain a clean and understandable commit history.

## Secrets

You need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

- `ARTIFACTORY_USER`: Your Artifactory username.
- `ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY`: Your Artifactory API key.

By following these guidelines, you can leverage the Gradle Build and Publish action to manually control the build and release process of your Java projects.
